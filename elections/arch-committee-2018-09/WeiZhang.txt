Introduction:

I am now working as a Senior Engineer in Huawei Corporation,

K8s/docker/kata-containers to other departments and Huawei Public Cloud. 

I was once a docker developer and now is an active kata contributor, and has been

to make excellent open source project and then make a better product based on 
Kata to Huawei customers.
